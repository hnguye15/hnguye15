# Hello world!
I am a 4th year student at UNB, Fredericton, Canada. Welcome to my personal GitHub page for my works!
## What I did as a programmer
I sometimes get inspirations from my classes to write some personal projects either for self-study or for fun!

I also worked as a programmer for a small group of inspiring students who were looking to create video games! Our group was named Influx Games:
* Director: Thomas Tam
* Lead writer: Thomas Tam
* Writer: Garrett MacLaughlin
* Lead artist: Sunnyteddy22
* Artist: Esther Lee, Brilliant Nguyen & Pippa Painter
* Lead Programmer: Brilliant Nguyen (@YourFrostyFriend)
* Programmer: Ky Nguyen (@hnguye15), Bohdan Savchuk, Daphne Dairo-Singerr, Isaac Lee, Isaac Shoebottom

## What we did as Influx Games

### IBO - The game
We were working on a pixel art 2D platformer where you play as IBO. He is a robot recently awakened from his long slumber after a mysterious apocalypse that happened centuries ago. He was programmed to restore humanity by retrieving relics of the past to fabricate a species that could resemble humans to carry on the legacy. But what lies beyond the gate?

Our game files are located in a private repository from our Azure DevOps project since it is still WIP. Our progress was originally made in Unreal Engine 5, but we are planning to migrate the game to GoDot!

### GMTK - Game Jam 2024
We participated in GMTK Game Jam of Summer 2024 where we only had 96 hours to create a video game! It was a short in time, yet long in effort journey as we were working tirelessly throughout the day and even throughout the night with very little sleep to try to complete our game called *License to Build*, which was based on the provided theme *Built to Scale*. It is a physics-based pixel art 2D platformer where you play as a construction worker who has to go through the challenges of each level using several tools and a physics gun that could scale things bigger or smaller.

### GMTK - Game Jam 2025

Our second time participating in GMTK Game Jame during Summer 2025! Just like last time, we had only 96 hours to create a video game based on the provided theme from the announcers. This year's theme was "Loop". This time, our project lead and programming lead were like: "Why not just make a fun little horror game?". Then we agreed on it and finally put out a game called *Dysthymia*. It's a pixel-art 2D-platformer story-driven horror game about a deep and lasting depression that manifests as a loop of dreams. We very much enjoyed developing the game, and thanks to a combination of our experience from the last game and our very talented artists, we were able to finish all the artworks more than 12 hours before the game was due and submitted the game 4 hours before the deadline!
